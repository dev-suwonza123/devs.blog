## Markdown as Blog

![](campo01.jpg)

Quite happy to use markdown to draft document or blog post, but publish to web is 
a little trouble which need to 

1. find a web hosting
2. setup blog framework (e.g. wordpress)
3. design layout, menu navigation, etc..
4. start draft post
5. publish the post

Can we just simply write to markdown file and post it?

Yes, [casual-markdown-blog](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-blog) is coded for this purpose! 
It just use a single html to manage a markdown blog site on static web-hosting.

1. find a free web hosting. e.g. github-page
2. setup some basic info (e.g. blog site title, about me) in index.md
3. start draft posts in markdown.

the blog site is ready by adding the file of [index.html](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-blog/blob/main/source/index.html)

Check out the sample sites
