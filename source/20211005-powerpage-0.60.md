### PowerPage - Coding desktop application using javascript/html/css

I had longed for a web browser which has DB connectivity, so that can coding 
JavaScript/html/css application like Electron. Finally I aware that can code one by myself.

["PowerPage"](https://github.com/casualwriter/powerpage) (version 0.60) is a 
lightweight web browser with DB capability and windows accessibility, 
for rapid development of javascript/html application.

"PowerPage" will connect to database, load startup page using Microsoft web-browser 
control (equivalent to IE11), and communicate with html/js page 
by pb:// or ps:// protocol to provide below features

* (Run) Call External Program
* (File) Access file system
* (DB) Database Accessibility
* (PB) Call Powerbuilder Windows/Functions
* (Misc) Global variables, sessions information

It is a **portable solution** with single executable file (need powerbuilder run-time). 
Just download, run and start coding!

More, it released with some useful "sample applications"

1. [Powerpage Markdown Editor](https://github.com/casualwriter/powerpage-markdown)
2. [Powerpage Web Crawler](https://github.com/casualwriter/powerpage-web-crawler) 
3. Powerpage Document Framework 


Hope you like it, and have a great day,
